## The Problem

**800 million people** depend on remittances. Migrant workers in the US, UAE, UK, and Canada
send money home to India, Philippines, Nigeria, and Mexico — but:

- Legacy providers (Western Union, banks) charge **7–10% fees**
- Transfers take **3–5 business days**
- Hundreds of millions remain **unbanked** with no access to formal finance
- $56 billion in fees are extracted from migrants annually

---

## The Solution: RemitFlow

RemitFlow is a **non-custodial cross-border payment platform** built on Stellar that:

- ✅ Settles in **3–5 seconds** (Stellar's consensus)
- ✅ Charges **~$0.001** per transaction (Stellar base fee)
- ✅ Supports **180+ countries** via Stellar Anchors
- ✅ Generates **4–5% APY** on idle funds via Stellar AMM
- ✅ Works without a bank account (wallet-native)
- ✅ Fully **non-custodial** (SEP-10, SEP-24, SEP-31)
